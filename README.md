# TTV Ad Compromiser

## What is it?
There are any number of reasons why you might be seeing Ads on Twitch.tv but, no matter the cause, having a stream interrupted is annoying. Twitch has made a substantial improvement recently with the addition of a miniplayer which will appear during an ad-break so that the livestream can still be viewed, although audio is muted.

TTV Ad Compromiser enables audio in this miniplayer when it appears. Unlike a conventional ad-blocker the ad is still able to run, but the content remains accessible to a viewer.

## Installation
Installation is pretty straight forward:
1. Clone this repository or download the zip [here](https://github.com/LasTechLabs/TTV-Ad-Compromiser/archive/main.zip)
    1. If you downloaded the zip, unzip it.
2. In chrome go to chrome://extensions
3. Click "load unpacked"
4. Browse to the unzipped folder downloaded in step 1
5. Select the folder and click okay, the extension is now added to your browser

## I use firefox, what should I do? 
Idk, cry probably. I don't think porting should be too difficult so maybe at some point in the future...
